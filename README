Ok, before you dive in :-)

These 6 simple steps are the essentials to get you smoothly up and running...

  1. Create your own config/database.yml (you can copy one of the sample files in there and edit it)

  2. Edit the db/bootstrap/users.yml file to contain your personal "admin" user details

  3. Edit the db/bootstrap/setting.yml file to contain "values" for your initial settings 

  4. Open a shell and run the following to create your database and setup the prepared defaults. 

		export RAILS_ENV=development
		cd <path_into_your_baseapp_direcory>
		rake db:bootstrap
